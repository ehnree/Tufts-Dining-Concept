1) What was accomplished during the week
	

 This week we moved away from front-end design 
 and started working on our server.  Unfortunately 
 we couldn't schedule enough time as a group to put 
 together something concrete but we're able to scrape 
 the Tufts menu and were trying to figure out how to 
 organize it onto our own webpage.

2) Challenges and issues faced by the team

	The current Tufts Dining menu stores all of the 
	food items under one class instead of unique classes
	for meal and food-type.  We are currently working 
	on organizing the data into our ideal menu structure
	given the jumble of data we're able to scrape from
	the website.  

3) Next week's goals 

	We still need to make progress on the framework and backend
	of our site. We hope to make a bit more progress on the
	MongoDB database and gain better working knowledge of the 
	APIs we want to utilize.  We have not yet had the chance
	to set up our express framework, but we plan on having 
	it, along with the scraping and our databases, up and running on
	the site soon so that we can turn our attention to the review
	feature and other extra touches that will make our site
	more convenient for the student body than the current Tufts
	Dining page is.

#Comments by Ming
* Have you scraped the Tufts menus yet?
* "One thing to keep in mind is the API. We need to figure our the Twilio and Flickr API's to integrate into our page" --any progress on this?
* Where's status report 3?
